            Hi, I am Greg. I am 20 years old and I love programming. I started 5 years ago, but I wasn't working on any big projects. I was using BBCode and I found it interesting. After some years I got interested in html and I have created my first webpage with tables. I also love ping-pong and I used to play it a lot. I even took part in (a competition | competitions) but that was years ago. Now I am focusing on (Javascript | Javascript & ES6) and frameworks.

                    I have already made a few projects in my life. At the time of creation, I had little to no coding experience. When I look
                    back at those projects, I realise that they weren't developed perfectly and need some improvements. I worked on these
                    in 2017 and, nevertheless the unprofessional code structure, I think the concept behind the projects are very interesting.
                    All of those projects are made completely by me (except Projekt E.14, where I was designing HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
                    The most difficult one was my old portfolio, which took me almost a full week of coding, 4 to 6 hours a day.

                When I started coding, I was mainly using HTML tables, as many beginners did. A few weeks later I started working with div elements and DOCTYPE 4.01 Transitional. I wasn't aware of alternatives, so I kept working with this method for a long time. Eventually I started using HTML5. At the end of 2017 I was introduced into semantic elements. In 2018 I started learning as hard as I could and that's how I started using HTML & CSS grid views, the CSS preprocessor Sass for better management and usability, gulp.js and Git. I think that I made a lot of progress and am still continuing to learn new technologies.
